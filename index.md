##### **1. Invoice Period**

Microsoft invoices you as a reseller based on the date you have signed
the CSP contract with them. If you signed this contract on the 7^(th) of
the month. Each invoice, and the reported usage will be reported over
the period from the 7^(th) {: .lh-20 } up until the 7^(th) of the next month.
CloudBilling allows you to move away from this period and invoice your
clients as you want. You can match the calendar month or match the
Microsoft period. If, however your invoice period does not match with
Microsoft, due to the different period differences can arise. This is
something you cannot avoid.
